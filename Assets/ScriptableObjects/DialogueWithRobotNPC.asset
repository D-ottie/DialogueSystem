  - Thank Goodness you are here Heisenberg! They have taken all the money. They came
    so quick, I didnt have a chance to stop them.
  - Oh My Goodness Jesse, I worked so hard to get all of that! Where did they go?
  - They took off in a van not so long ago, they should be on the dirt road up ahead.
  - Remind me never to trust you with my cash!
  - 'Sorry man! '
